### Howdy!

I'm AnonymousHacker1279, a growing developer from Catawba, North Carolina.

I'm an avid programmer and engineer, who also enjoys gaming, rock and heavy metal, and critical thinking. As of August 2022, I am an Eagle Scout from Troop 823 of the Lakeland District.

My current main projects are my [Immersive Weapons](https://github.com/AnonymousHacker1279/ImmersiveWeapons) Minecraft mod and 
my [TitanBot](https://github.com/AnonymousHacker1279/TitanBot) Discord bot. I've had a lot of other past projects, but these two easily have gathered most of my time and attention.

I am currently a Customer Service Lead at Food Lion in Newton, NC. I am actively looking for full time career opportunities post-graduation. 

Here's some statistics for my GitHub profile:
